Techmeme Author Filter README
=============================

Greasemonkey script to filter out unwanted authors' articles on
techmeme.com.

Usage
=====
Use the "Edit Author Filters" entry in the Greasemonkey menu to add
one or more space-separated words to filter on.  For example, filtering
on "billy smith" will hide articles by the following authors:

  * Billy Jones
  * Andrew Smith
  * Joseph Smithson

If you don't want the last author to match, then use something like this
instead:

    # only match on literal "billy" or literal "smith"
    "billy \bsmith\b"

You can use any other regular expression characters in the string as
well.
